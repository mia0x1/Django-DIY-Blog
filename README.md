# dev_blog

I created this blog using Django, HTML and CSS with the very helpful tutorial from djangogirls:
https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/

Made some minor adjustments by myself but the basis of the code was introduced by djangogirls. 

It was a little fun project. Would recommend if you want to learn something about backend webserver stuff :)
